            Abstract: <i>Physical activity (PA) is beneficial for cognitive and brain health during preadolescence. Given that
            childhood obesity (OB) is a public health concern, investi- gating this effect in children with OB is an important
            societal consideration. To identify the effects of weight status and PA on neuroelectric indices of executive function
            in preadolescence. Children were randomly assigned to a PA intervention or a wait-list control group and completed a
            task that manipulated inhibitory control, while task perfor- mance and neuroelectric (P3 component) outcomes were
            assessed. About 103 chil- dren with OB were matched to a sample of 103 normal weight (NW) children based on treatment
            allocation and demographic variables. Children with OB in the control group demonstrated reduced P3 amplitude from pre-
            to post-test, meanwhile those with OB in the PA intervention maintained P3 amplitude at post-test compared to pre-test.
            Additionally, NW children in the PA intervention group showed that decreased visceral adipose tissue corresponded with
            faster task performance, a relationship not observed in children with OB. These results suggest that a 9-month PA
            intervention may be particu- larly beneficial to the cognitive and brain health of children with OB. These results are
            important to consider given the public health concerns associated with childhood OB. </i>

            Abstract: <i> Physical activity (PA) can improve physical, mental, cognitive, and brain health throughout the
              lifespan. During preadolescent childhood, the benefits of PA for cognitive health have been widely studied, with
              evidence indicating enhanced executive control, improved aca- demic performance, and adaptation in underlying brain
              structure and function. Across school age children, the predominant literature has focused on preadolescent
              children, with a comparatively smaller body of evidence in adolescent children. Yet, preliminary findings suggest
              improvements in verbal, numeric, and reasoning abilities as well as academic achievements. Further, benefits of PA
              are also rarely examined in preschool children. Con- sequently, lack of standardization across studies has led to
              various approaches in the mea- surement of PA and fitness. However, since implementing tools that objectively
              quantify active play, PA has been related to better executive function, language acquisition, and aca- demic
              achievement. Despite evidence that PA promotes cognitive and brain health during development, a growing number of
              schools have minimized PA opportunities across the school day. The minimization of PA along with several other
              factors, including lack of active commuting to school, nutrition transition, and availability of electronic devices,
              for example, has reduced children’s physical and mental health. Accordingly, today’s children have be- come
              increasingly inactive, which affects public health and contributes to educational con- cerns. By dedicating time to
              active play, sports, physical education, and other forms of PA, children are best positioned to thrive in both the
              physical and cognitive domains. </i>

            Abstract: <i>The prevalence of physical inactivity in children has become a global pandemic and has consequences for
              physical, as well as cognitive and brain, health. Single bouts of physical activity (PA), however, have shown a
              transient, positive effect on cognitive performance in preadolescent children. Acute bouts of moderate to vigorous PA
              have demonstrated benefits for cognition, including attention and executive function. These acute effects of PA on
              cognitive performance can be seen both immediately after and following a delay from the cessation of PA. Further,
              event-related potentials have been used to delineate real-time neural responses to behavioral tasks after PA
              interventions. A short bout of moderate-intensity aerobic PA serves to increase the allocation of attentional
              resources and improved cognitive processing and stimulus classification speed. As such, there are implications for
              evaluating the effect of PA within schools. Several neural mechanisms are suggested to explain the observed
              improvements in executive function after PA, such as the importance of brain-derived neurotrophic factor on
              synaptogenesis, the expression of human growth factors, the activated release of catecholamines, and increased blood
              lactate levels. The ensuing descriptive review demonstrates the current understanding of the effects of acute PA on
              childhood brain and cognition and may serve as a basis for understanding PA-induced improvements in academic
              achievement. </i>

            Abstract: <i> The effects of optimal and insufficient hydration on human health have received increasing investigation
              in recent years. Specifically, water is an essential nutrient for human health, and the importance of hydration on
              cognition has continued to attract research interest over the last decade. Despite this focus, children remain a
              relatively understudied population relative to the effects of hydration on cognition. Of those studies investigating
              children, findings have been inconsistent, resulting from utilizing a wide variety of cogni- tive domains and
              cognitive assessments, as well as varied hydration protocols. Here, our aim is to create a primer for assessing
              cognition during hydration research in children. Specifically, we review the definition of cognition and the domains
              of which it is composed, how cognition has been measured in both field- and laboratory-based assessments, results from
              neuroimaging methods, and the relationship between hydration and academic achievement in children. Lastly, future
              research considerations are discussed.</i>

            Abstract: <i>The aim of this study was to reanalyze several datasets to investigate the relation of childhood aerobic
              fitness on cognition via a number of task performance outcomes and the P3 event-related brain potential component
              during a modified flanker task, which modulates inhibitory control demands. In a sample of 702 preadolescent
              children (ages 8–11; 342 females), demographic measures of age, sex, IQ, socioeconomic status, and pubertal status
              were considered along with aerobic fitness (i.e., VO2peak%). Correlational analyses were conducted to determine the
              influence of the demographic variables and aerobic fitness on inhibitory control outcomes of response accuracy,
              reaction time (RT), response variability, interference control, cognitive strategies, P3 amplitude, and P3 latency.
              Subsequent hierarchical regression analyses were performed with significant demographic factors in the first step
              and aerobic fitness in the final step. Results indicated that after accounting for significant demographic variables
              specific to each dependent outcome, aerobic fitness was positively related to response accuracy, with no such
              relations observed for response speed (RT) for congruent and incongruent conditions of the flanker task. However,
              greater aerobic fitness was associated with less RT variability and lower accuracy interference. In terms of
              cognitive strategies, greater fitness was also associated with better discrimination accuracy as well as faster and
              better quality of information uptake. Across a 15-site region of interest around the topographic maximum, findings
              indicated that aerobic fitness was positively associated with larger P3 amplitude during incongruent trials. No such
              relation was observed for P3 latency. Relying on a large aggregated dataset, we demonstrated that aerobic fitness
              may be particularly beneficial to the allocation of attentional resources, as indexed by P3 amplitude as well as
              response accuracy and intraindividual variability. These findings, while generalized across inhibitory control
              demands, were especially related to trials that required greater amounts of inhibition. Thus, aerobic fitness may
              benefit brain and behavioral outcomes during childhood and has public health implications for the role of childhood
              physical activity on aspects of cognition that underlie scholastic performance and lifelong effective
              functioning.</i>
