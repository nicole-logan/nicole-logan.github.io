        <h1>Hi! I'm Nicole.</h1>
        <p>I am a 4th year PhD Candidate at Northeastern University's Center for Cognitive and Brain Health. I research
          the
          effects of lifestyle factors such as physical activity, obesity, and mental health on cognitive and brain
          function
          and structure throughout the lifespan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this research is to identify lifestyle interventions which may help to protect against cognitive
          decline and
          neural degradation, and moreover enhance executive function and quality of life.
